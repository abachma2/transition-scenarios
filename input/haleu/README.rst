Transition to HALEU reactors
----------------------------

This directory contains the input files and analysis of multiple 
transition scenarios to advanced reactors fueled by High Assay 
Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). 

Analysis:
=========
The analysis directory contains jupyter notebooks 
to calculate and compare resource requirements of each fuel cycle 
scenario simulated. All of the figures created in the jupyter notebook
are saved in the ``figures/`` directory. The notebooks are titled to describe 
the scenarios analyzed in the notebook. ``analysis/initial_analysis.ipynb`` is the 
analysis used to write [this article](https://doi.org/10.1051/epjn/2021021).

Inputs:
===========
This directory holds all of the input files for fuel cycle transition 
scenarios this project.

The input files in the repository are the ``.xml`` input files for 
|Cyclus|. The input files are titled by the type of advanced 
reactors to be deployed and the demand growth of the scenario. 
Each of the input files read in other ``.xml`` files from the 
``inputs/united_states/`` directory for the 
light water reactors (LWR) currently deployed in the US, the recipes 
for LWR fuel cycle, and the deployment times for the LWRs. The LWR 
files and the ``inputs/united_states_2020.xml`` |Cyclus| input files 
are generated by running 
``/transition-scenarios/scripts/create_cyclus_input.py``. The 
``input/united_states_2020.xml`` was then altered to create the other
scenarios in the directory by adding in necessary input parameters. 

Definitions for each advanced reactor and their corresponding recipes
are in ``inputs/united_states/reactors/`` and ``inputs/united_states/recipes``, 
respectively. Each of the necessary files are read into the ``.xml`` files 
in ``inputs/`` when |Cyclus| is run. 

This directory also contains ``create_DI.ipynb``, which uses the functions in 
``scripts/create_AR_DeployInst.py`` to write the DeployInst for each scenario 
in this project. 


Order_testing:
==============
This subdirectory contains information related to an investigation into 
how the order prototypes are listed in an input file when cycamore::ManagerInst
is used to deploy agents based on a specified demand. Files in this 
subdirectory include the input files and a jupyter notebook with the 
analysis.

Parametric-study:
=================
This directory contains information related to a parametric study on 
how the facility cap for the fuel fabrication or enrichment facilities for 
the transition to HALEU-fueled reactors. This was performed because of 
observed deficits from the energy demand when different enrichment and
fabrication facilities were used for LEU and HALEU. 

Senitivity-analysis:
====================
This directory contains work for sensitivity anlaysis on the scenarios developed 
for this project. The sensitivity analysis is done by coupling |Cyclus| to Dakota.
This directory has three subdirectories (`oat/`, `synergistic/`, `global/`) for 
each type of analysis performed. Each of those subdirectories contain more 
subdirectories for each variable or set of variables changed in that set of 
analysis. 

run_multiple_cyclus_inputs.bash 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Bash script to loop over and run multiple cyclus input files in ``inputs/``.
